#This is just an idea
A version of Encryption code that will encrypt by compressing text. it will do this by assigning a character to a set of two letters.
For example, it could assign # for the letter combination ab. Each set of 2 a-z letters will have a character for it. 
that would need a combination of every letter a-z and a space, so I would need 27^2 characters to represent each combination, so I will need 729 characters. That'a a lot, but there are enough characters.
this will reduce the amount of letters in the text by half, reducing the data taken by the text. It will also encrypt it at the same time
However, this will only work for a-z letters, for other characters like numbers, it would need more characters to represent the new character sets.
